# Astrocoders Fullstack Challenge

Hi, thank you for taking on our challenge! We hope that you'll learn a lot, create an awesome project and join the Astrocoders team.

In this test, we will evaluate the knowledge you already have about ReactJS and your ability to learn new technologies. In order to complete it.

## How to start
Fork this repo so we can start counting the time

## Deadline

2 weeks after forking this repo.

## Summary

Build a simple web app that gives a user an initial 1000 credits and this user can transfer theses credits to a fake user that you should also create.
Each transfer should include a configurable fee  of transaction
The app should also be able to display the current balance or a given user and enlist the history of incoming and outgoing transfer for the user.

## Stack and technical requisites
For the fontrend we use GraphQL, ReasonML, Node+TypeScript and Rust sometimes around here. But you are free to use whatever you want as long as the client-server communication is built around GraphQL and Relay conventions.

The frontend should be built in the React paradigm and follow Relay conventions.

### Why

If we choose a closed tools stack you'll never be able to surprise us with what you are really good with.


## What we'll pay attention to
> "The devil is in the details".

We'll pay attention to implementation details and corner cases handling. Also to how well you deal with FP programming style.

## Mock ups for overall idea
[WIP]
